# ðŸ§° Libft

## Description
Libft is a custom library written in C, recreated from scratch. This project helped me master C standard library functions while learning memory management and data structures. The library includes functions like `malloc`, `free`, `strdup`, and more.

## Features
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, etc.)
- String manipulation functions (`strdup`, `strchr`, `strcpy`, etc.)
- Functions for linked lists and other data structures
